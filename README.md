# HSSeniorProject #

This was my high school senior project. I'm adding it here so it can be shared more easily.

## Installation and Usage ##

To run this project. download the "GA Orbits" directory and open it as a Java 11 project in IntelliJ IDEA or another Java IDE. There should be no other setup necessary in IntelliJ. Clicking run should build the project and run it successfully. A successful run will end with two open windows, one with animation and the other without.
